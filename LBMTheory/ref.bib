   abstract = {Adsorption has been studied for decades in either petroleum or chemical industry. However, the detailed adsorption behavior is yet not well understood in nanoporous media with complex pore structures and surface properties, especially for subcritical gases when capillary condensation might occur. Shale (mudrock) has complex pore systems as a result of heterogeneous mineralogy and diagenesis, and interparticle (interP) and intraparticle (intraP) pores are two main components. Understanding gas adsorption and phase transition behavior in different pore systems is essential for petrophysical characterization, reserve estimation and production forecast. In this study, we use lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to study nitrogen (subcritical) and methane (supercritical) adsorption behavior in reconstructed shale nanopore systems. The model accounts for the van der Walls (vdW) forces between fluid molecules by incorporating a modified pseudopotential model based on Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS). Rock-fluid interaction is also considered by introducing phenomenological surface forces, which take two different forms for subcritical and supercritical gases respectively. The correlation between parameters defined in LBM and physical properties (i.e. density, pressure, isosteric heat of adsorption) is established systematically. Using the developed model, we observe quantitative agreement between LBM and lattice density functional theory (LDFT)/experimental data in terms of adsorption isotherms and density distributions. We then compare adsorption behavior in two ‘model’ interP and intraP pore systems and a synthesized polyethylene porous medium with more complex pore shapes. We observe three adsorption stages for subcritical gas adsorption: a) early capillary condensation near grain contacts or sharp corners, forming isolated pendular rings or fluid clusters; b) growing, merging, and spreading of the isolated condensed phase, forming circular gas/liquid meniscus; c) the condensed phase becomes fully-connected across the geometry, leaving isolated gas bubbles. We observe a signature behavior for the adsorption isotherm of intraP pore system, where a stepped feature occurs around relative pressure of 0.8, and the adsorption uptake for the polyethylene porous medium is bounded by the upper and lower limits given by the interP and intraP pore systems. On the other hand, we find that supercritical methane adsorption in mesoporous media is less sensitive to pore shape, but rather controlled by the specific surface area. The existence of micropores also affects the adsorption uptake.},

   abstract = {It is known that thermodynamic properties of a system change upon confinement. To know how, is important for modelling of porous media. We propose to use Hill’s systematic thermodynamic analysis of confined systems to describe two-phase equilibrium in a nanopore. The integral pressure, as defined by the compression energy of a small volume, is then central. We show that the integral pressure is constant along a slit pore with a liquid and vapor in equilibrium, when Young and Young–Laplace’s laws apply. The integral pressure of a bulk fluid in a slit pore at mechanical equilibrium can be understood as the average tangential pressure inside the pore. The pressure at mechanical equilibrium, now named differential pressure, is the average of the trace of the mechanical pressure tensor divided by three as before. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we computed the integral and differential pressures, ̂p and p, respectively, analysing the data with a growing-core methodology. The value of the bulk pressure was confirmed by Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. The pressure difference times the volume, V, is the subdivision potential of Hill, (p − ̂p)V = ɛ. The combined simulation results confirm that the integral pressure is constant along the pore, and that ɛ/V scales with the inverse pore width. This scaling law will be useful for prediction of thermodynamic properties of confined systems in more complicated geometries.},

   abstract = {In conventional permeable media, once pore volume (PV) is known, the amount of fluid-in-place can be estimated. This is because the fluid is locally homogeneous, pores are generally larger than 100 nm, and surface adsorption is negligible. In shale media, in addition to PV, knowledge of pore-size distribution, total organic content, and chemistry of the rock is required. Fluid molecules in shale media can be found in three different states: (1) free molecules in the pores, (2) adsorbed molecules on the pore surface, and (3) dissolved molecules in the organic matter. Of the three, the first two mechanisms are discussed in the literature. In this work, we compute for the first time the amount of dissolved molecules. To compute the fluids in shale media, we divide the pores into sizes greater than 10 nm and sizes less than 10 nm. In pores greater than 10 nm, the interface curvature affects phase behavior, and fluid phases are homogeneous. Therefore, they can be described by conventional equations of state. Our calculations show that retrograde condensation increases in nanopores; the upper dewpoint increases, and the lower dewpoint decreases. These calculations are supported by experimental measurements. Gas solubility in water and liquid normal decane shows a modest increase with curvature. In pores less than 10 nm, the fluids become inhomogeneous, and the direct use of conventional equations of state cannot be applied even with adjusted critical pressure and temperature. We suggest the use of molecular modeling. A model such as the Langmuir adsorption isotherm is merely a curve fitting of the data. We use available data in shale media, which are mainly limited to excess sorption of methane and carbon dioxide, to compare to our thermodynamic model computations. This is the first attempt to compare measured data in shale and predictions that are based on the integration of molecular modeling and classical thermodynamic modeling.},

These closures were deduced through computational experiments performed using an implicit formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method with a BGK collision model. Unlike the explicit schemes described in the literature, this implicit implementation requires iterative calculations, which, however, are local in nature. While the computational cost per time step is modestly increased, the implicit scheme dramatically expands the parameter space in multiphase flow calculations which can be simulated economically. The closure relations obtained in our study are limited to a regular array of uniformly sized bubbles and were obtained by simulating the rise behaviour of a single bubble in a periodic box. The effect of volume fraction on the rise characteristics was probed by changing the size of the box relative to that of the bubble. While spherical bubbles exhibited the expected hindered rise behaviour, highly distorted bubbles tended to rise cooperatively. The closure for the drag force, obtained in our study through computational experiments, captured both hindered and cooperative rise. A simple model for the virtual mass coefficient, applicable to both spherical and distorted bubbles, was also obtained by fitting simulation results. The virtual mass coefficient for isolated bubbles could be correlated with the aspect ratio of the bubbles.},

The bubble rises due to gravitational force. However, deformation and velocity of the bubble depend on the balance of other forces produced by surface tension, inertia, and viscosity. Depending on the primary forces acting on the system, bubble dynamics can be classified into different regimes. These regimes are achieved computationally by systematically changing the values of Morton number (Mo) and Bond number (Bo) within the following ranges (1×10-5<Mo<3×104) and (1<Bo<1×103). Terminal shape and Reynolds number (Re) are interactive quantities that depend on size of bubble, surface tension, viscosity, and density of surrounding fluid. Accurate simulation of terminal shape and Re for each regime could be satisfactorily predicted and simulated, since they are also functions of Mo and Bo.

   abstract = {Shales will play an important role in the successful transition of energy from fossil-based resources to renewables in the coming decades. Aside from being a significant source of low-carbon intensity fuels, like natural gas, they also serve as geologic seals of subsurface formations that may be used to isolate nuclear waste, sequester CO2, or store intermittent energy (e.g., solar hydrogen). Despite their importance, shales pose significant engineering and environmental challenges due to their nanoporous structure and extreme heterogeneity that spans at least ~10 orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Two challenges inhibit a system-level understanding: (1) the physics of fluid flow and phase behavior in shales are poorly understood due to the dominant molecular interactions between minerals and fluids under confinement, and (2) the apparent lack of scale separation that prevents a reliable (closed) description of the physics at any single scale of observation. In this review, we focus on the latter issue and discuss scale translation, which in its broadest sense is transforming data or simulations from one spatiotemporal scale to another. While effective scale translation is not exclusive to shales, but all geologic porous media, the need for it is especially acute in shales given their high degree of heterogeneity. Classical theories like homogenization, while indispensable, fail when scales are not separated. Other methods, like numerical upscaling, scale-translate in only one direction: small to large, but not the reverse, called downscaling. However, the confluence of advances in three areas are bringing challenging problems such as shales within reach: increased computational power and scalable algorithms; high-resolution imaging and multi-modal data acquisition; and machine learning to process massive amounts of data. While these advances equip geoscientists with a wide array of experimental and computational tools, no individual tool can probe the entire gamut of heterogeneity in shales. Their effective use, therefore, requires an ability to bridge between various data types obtained at different scales. The aim of this review is to present a coherent account of computational and experimental methods that may be used to achieve just that, i.e., to perform scale translation. We provide a broader definition of scale translation, one that transcends classical homogenization and upscaling methods, but is consistent with them and accommodates notions like downscaling and data translation. After a brief introduction to homogenization, we review hybrid methods, numerical upscaling and its recent extensions, multiscale computing, high-resolution imaging, and machine learning. We place particular emphasis on multiscale computing and propose an algorithmic framework to bridge between the pore (micro) and Darcy (macro) scales. Throughout the paper, we draw comparisons between the various methods and highlight their (often hidden) similarities, differences, benefits, and pitfalls. We finally conclude with two case studies on shales that exemplify some of the methods presented.},

For the proposed algorithms, the quality of the initial guess, thus the convergence speed, are directly related to the existence of narrow solution windows. In this work, new, extremely simple solution windows are proposed, which depends only on feed compositions. It is proved that novel solution windows are always smaller than previously proposed ones. Numerical experiments are carried out for a very large number of randomly generated flashes, showing that the use of new solution windows systematically decreases the number of iterations required for convergence. In the range of number of components usually encountered in compositional reservoir simulations, the reduction in number of iterations is about 15% as compared to the fastest previous formulation.},

   abstract = {Multiphase flash calculations and phase stability analysis are central in compositional reservoir and chemical process simulators. For instance, in some simulations, a huge amount of phase equilibrium calculations is required (the most important part of the computational effort). Moreover, a single failure may cause significant error propagations leading to false solutions. Thus, it is imperative that calculation algorithms are efficient and highly robust. The most difficult regions in mixture phase envelopes are in the vicinity of singularities: critical points for flash calculations and the stability test limit locus for stability analysis. For these conditions, all algorithms have difficulties to converge. Traditionally, a number of successive substitution iterations (SSI) are performed before switching to the second-order Newton method (many SSI iteration may be required before switch very close to singularities). The Trust-Region method has the advantage of performing a Newton step whenever the Hessian is definite positive; otherwise, the Trust-Region corrects the Hessian matrix by adding a diagonal element to make it positive definite, thus a descent direction is guaranteed. The Trust-Region limits the solution within a trust-radius, which is updated automatically at each iteration level, depending on the quality of the quadratic approximation. If the function is convex, the trust-radius enables larger changes in iteration variables, otherwise restricted steps are used to ensure a progress towards the solution. The proposed Trust-Region algorithm, as well as a hybrid methodology that combines SSI, Newton and Trust-Region steps, are tested for multiphase flash calculations and stability analysis on a variety of mixtures involving hydrocarbon components, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, exhibiting complicated phase envelopes. The proposed method compares favorably to the widely used SSI-Newton methods with various independent variables. The more difficult a test point is, the more spectacular the algorithm acts from both efficiency and reliability perspectives. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Numerical algorithms commonly used for dynamic PNM including IMPES (implicit pressure explicit saturation) and IMP-SIMS (implicit pressure semi-implicit saturation) can be numerically unstable or inaccurate for challenging flow regimes such as low capillary number (Ca) flow and unfavorable displacements. We perform comprehensive analyses of IMPES and IMP-SIMS for a wide range of flow regimes under drainage conditions and develop a novel fully implicit (FI) algorithm to address their limitations. Our simulations show the following: (1) While IMPES was reported to be numerically unstable for low Ca flow, using a smoothed local pore-body capillary pressure curve appears to produce stable simulations. (2) Due to an approximation for the capillary driving force, IMP-SIMS can deviate from quasi-static solutions at equilibrium states especially in heterogeneous networks. (3) Both IMPES and IMP-SIMS introduce mass conservation errors. The errors are small for networks with cubic pore bodies (less than 1.4% for IMPES and 1.2% for IMP-SIMS). They become much greater for networks with square-tube pore bodies (up to 45% for IMPES and 46% for IMP-SIMS). Conversely, the new FI algorithm is numerically stable and mass conservative regardless of the flow regimes and pore geometries. It also precisely recovers the quasi-static solutions at equilibrium states. The FI framework has been extended to include compressible two-phase flow, multicomponent transport, and phase change dynamics. Example simulations of two-phase displacements accounting for phase change show that evaporation and condensation can suppress fingering patterns generated during invasion.},

While the nanoconfined phase behavior has been extensively studied in a single nanopore, its manifestation in complex nanopore networks remains poorly understood and rigorously derived macroscopic phase behavior formulations are not yet available. We develop a novel upscaling framework for deriving macroscopic phase behavior formulations in realistic nanopore networks (e.g., obtained from high-resolution digital images of shale samples). The framework employs a generalized phase equilibrium model that explicitly accounts for the impact of capillary pressure and multicomponent adsorption in each pore. Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium across the pore network, macroscopic phase behavior variables for the entire pore network are then derived by integrating the variables from the individual pores. This leads to a macroscopic network-scale phase equilibrium model that naturally accounts for the size- and geometry-dependent nanoconfinement effects of a complex pore structure. Simulated phase behaviors using three multiscale pore networks demonstrate that (1) the phase behavior in a pore network—controlled by the multiscale pore structure—significantly deviates from that in a single nanopore and (2) due to capillary trapping of the liquid phase and competitive adsorption on the pore wall, heavier components tend to reside in smaller pores and suppress the bubble point pressure therein. The upscaled phase behavior model shares the same mathematical structure as that of a standard phase behavior model and can thus be readily incorporated in commercial reservoir simulators.},

   abstract = {In this paper, an alternative model is presented to simultaneously achieve thermodynamic consistency, leading to high-density ratios, and surface tension adjustment capability based on the pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). These features are achieved by adding two relatively simple terms, each with an adjustable coefficient, selected from the Taylor expansion of the original interaction force, one for achieving and maintaining thermodynamic consistency, and the other for adjusting the surface tension independent of the density ratio. The model also takes advantage of being independent of using SRT, MRT, 2D or 3D lattice models. The capability of the model is evaluated and verified by performing several static and dynamic benchmark test cases. First, the coexistence densities extracted for a flat interface from the model are compared with those of the Maxwell equal area rule in a wide temperature range. Results show that the thermodynamic consistency is well achieved and the coexistence densities are independent of the surface tension strength as well. Next, the well-known Laplace law for a droplet is evaluated and satisfied with the model. In addition, a wide range of surface tension values is achievable at a fixed temperature by adjusting the surface tension adjustment coefficient. After that, the ellipsoidal droplet oscillation is simulated with a good agreement between the analytical and numerical results for the oscillation period. The spurious velocities around the droplet are then evaluated and shown to be reasonable, and comparatively low even at a relatively high-density ratio around of 2400. It was found that the magnitude of these velocities can be further reduced, especially at high-density ratios, by reducing the liquid to gas dynamic viscosity ratio or equivalently increasing the gas to liquid kinematic viscosity ratio. Next, the stability, and the fascinating phenomenon of symmetric bifurcation of a rotating planar droplet are simulated and formation of two- and four-lobed shapes along with rigid rotation is presented depending on the value of the surface tension. Finally, the droplet impact on a liquid film is simulated at a relatively high-density ratio around of 720, and Reynolds number of 1440. However, the upper limit of physical parameters for simulating this phenomenon is found to be a density ratio of 720 and Re and We numbers of 6600 and 275, respectively. Effects of the surface tension strength are shown as well. The crown spread radius from the model agrees well with the analytical solution reported in the literature.},

Our study shows that the unachievable multi-bubble/droplet system is for an unphysical mass transfer, which we call “the big eat the small” – the smaller bubbles/droplets shrink, and eventually disappear while the bigger ones get bigger without a physical coalescence. In our present study, the unphysical mass transfer phenomenon is investigated, and the possible reason is explored. It is found that there is a spurious flow field formed between two bubbles or droplets with different shapes, and such flow field is exactly the transfer of high-density mass. In addition, it is found that the curvatures of the interfaces determine the direction of the spurious flow field, and for the definition of “the big eat the small”, “the big” refers to the interfaces that have larger radii of curvature while “the small” represents the interfaces with smaller radii of curvature. Multi-component multiphase (MCMP) LBM is also tested in this work and it is found to be free of the unphysical mass transfer. Moreover, all the cases show that the most likely reason for the unphysical mass transfer might be the essential attractive interaction forces of the pseudopotential LBM.},

On this basis, a full thin liquid film near the solid wall is successfully predicted, which proves that the single-component multiphase LB model integrated with various interaction forces is a good solution to this type of problem like hydraulic cavitating flow in microchannel. The further simulation indicates that the fluid-solid interaction strength (gs) has a significant effect on the formation of thin liquid film. A critical value (gs = −3.5) of fluid-solid interaction strength is found, and thin liquid film fails to be predicted at gs > −3.5. A simple simulation on the contact angle (θ) of droplet on the solid surface is conducted to analyze the reason for this phenomenon. It is found that a full thin liquid film could be successfully predicted only when the solid surface is fully wetted by liquid, i.e., θ = 0° corresponding to gs ≤ −3.5. The current research provides a potential way for future investigation on heat transfer accompanied by hydraulic cavitating flow.},

Simulation results indicate that the nonwetting phase (NWP) relative permeability increases with increasing Ca; while the effect of Ca on the wetting phase (WP) relative permeability depends on the wettability. When M > 1, the NWP relative permeability increase with increasing M in a strong wetting condition because of the lubricating effect. The amplitude of the NWP relative permeability may even exceed the single phase permeability. However, the exact value of the amplitude and where it occurs depends on M and the structure of the porous media. The WP relative permeability is insensitive to M. When the porous media converts from strong wetting condition to neutral wetting condition, the NWP relative permeability decreases while the WP relative permeability increases.},

The original pseudopotential model is first detailed, and several cubic equations of state, the Redlich–Kwong, Redlich–Kwong–Soave, and Peng–Robinson are then incorporated into the lattice Boltzmann model. A comparison of the numerical simulation achievements on the basis of density ratios and spurious currents is used for presentation of the details of phase separation in these non-ideal single-component systems. The paper demonstrates that the scheme for the inter-particle interaction force term as well as the force term incorporation method matters to achieve more accurate and stable results. The velocity shifting method is demonstrated as the force term incorporation method, among many, with accuracy and stability results. Kupershtokh scheme also makes it possible to achieve large density ratio (up to 104) and to reproduce the coexistence curve with high accuracy. Significant reduction of the spurious currents at vapor–liquid interface is another observation.

   abstract = {The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has proven to be a promising approach in handling multiphase flow problems. In the most widely applied pseudopotential-based LBM multiphase models, multiphase effects can be added in the form of forces, which is further divided into two aspects of force incorporation scheme and force expression. However, the effect of both aspects on coexistence densities and spurious current has not been evaluated systematically. In this paper, Modified Yuan-type and Zhang-type force expressions are chosen, and then they are incorporated into the lattice Boltzmann equation by the Shan-Chen and exact difference method force incorporation scheme to recover the Carnahan-Starling equation of state (EOS) with an additional surface tension term. Based on the computational results of two phases coexisting at a steady state, it can be observed that the force incorporation scheme affects the coexistence densities implicitly with different relaxation times and does not lead to a large difference in values. Force expression is found to greatly affect the achievable highest density ratio, of which the discrete gradient operator of the pseudopotential plays a crucial role. Spurious current is observed to be related to both the force expression and force incorporation scheme, and in our simulation a different force incorporation scheme brings about a large difference. Moreover, our modification on Yuan-type force expression not only improves the accuracy in capturing coexistence densities at low temperatures, but also provides the possibility of tuning the density ratio and surface tension independently at high density ratios. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The influences of interfacial tension, contact angle and the viscosity of oil on the flow characteristics of oil droplets, such as deformation and fracture were investigated after validating the model. The results indicate that deformation of the oil droplet is mainly determined by interfacial tension and oil viscosity, while the affect of contact angle is not substantial. With the increase of interfacial tension and the viscosity of oil, the maximum deformation of droplets before fracture decreases. It is found that the contact angle has a significant effect on the number of broken droplets and the shape of the oil droplets.

Most of the previous efforts had attempted to solve this problem by introducing tuning parameters, whose determination required empirical trial and error until acceptable thermodynamic consistency was achieved. In this study, we show that the problem can be alternatively solved by properly designing customized equations of state (EOSs) that replace any cubic EOS of choice during the computation of effective mass used in Shan-Chen forces. A two-parameter cubic-shaped customized EOS is introduced. Contrary to previous efforts, customization parameters in the new EOS are nonempirical and are rather derived from solving the integral mechanical stability equation, which neglects the need for any type of tuning for the attainment of rigorous thermodynamic consistency. The proposed approach reduces the errors of the coexisting densities and saturated pressure in the simulation to a maximum of 0.01% within the liquid-vapor density ratio range from O(1) to O(104), which had not been achieved in any of the previous tuning-based efforts.

One of the main open challenges in pore-scale modeling is the direct simulation of flows involving multicomponent mixtures with complex phase behavior. Reservoir fluid mixtures are often described through cubic equations of state, which makes diffuse-interface, or phase-field, theories particularly appealing as a modeling framework. What is still unclear is whether equation-of-state-driven diffuse-interface models can adequately describe processes where surface tension and wetting phenomena play important roles. Here we present a diffuse-interface model of single-component two-phase flow (a van der Waals fluid) in a porous medium under different wetting conditions. We propose a simplified Darcy-Korteweg model that is appropriate to describe flow in a Hele-Shaw cell or a micromodel, with a gap-averaged velocity. We study the ability of the diffuse-interface model to capture capillary pressure and the dynamics of vaporization-condensation fronts and show that the model reproduces pressure fluctuations that emerge from abrupt interface displacements (Haines jumps) and from the breakup of wetting films.},

As a type of numerical method for fluid flows, the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method has gained much success in a variety of complex flows, and certain OBCs have been suggested for the LBE in simulating simple single-phase flows. However, very few discussions on the OBCs have been made for the two-phase LBE method. In this work, three types of OBCs that are widely used in the LBE for single-phase flows, i.e., the Neumann boundary condition, the convective boundary condition, and the extrapolation boundary condition, are extended to a two-phase LBE method and their performances are investigated. The comprehensive results of several two-phase flows show that these boundary conditions behave quite differently in the simulations of two-phase flows. Specifically, it is found that the Neumann boundary condition and the extrapolation boundary condition give rather poor predictions, while the type of convective boundary conditions work well, although the choice of the convection velocity has some slight influences on the results.

   abstract = {One of the main difficulties when simulating nanoparticle transport in porous media is the lack of accurate fieldscale parameters to properly estimate particle retention across large distances. Furthermore, current field models are, in general, not based on mathematically rigorous upscaling techniques, and empirical models are being fed by experimental data. This study proposes a rigorous and practical way to connect pore-scale phenomena with Darcy-scale models, providing accurate macro-scales results. In order to carefully resolve nanoparticle transport at the pore-scale, we develop numerical solver based on the open-source C++ library OpenFOAM, able to account for shear-induced detachment of nanoparticles from the walls in addition to usual isotherm attachment/detachment processes. We employ an integrated approach to generate random, user-oriented, and periodic porous structures with tunable porosity and connectivity. A periodic face-centered cubic geometry is employed for simulations over a broad range of Péclet and Damköhler numbers, and effective parameters valid at the macro-scale are obtained by mean of volume averaging in periodic cells, as well as breakthrough approximates to asymptotic behaviour. Coupling between these techniques leads to a comprehensive estimation of a first-order kinetic rate for nanoparticle retention and the maximum retention capacity based on breakthrough curves and asymptotic curves. We apply this upscaling process to real cases found in literature, to estimate the penetration radius of a typical stimulation operation settling. The profiles are compared against different spatial discretization in the radial direction and different dimensionless numbers to study their impact upon travel distances. The present workflow gives a new insight into some aspects of pore-scale boundary conditions that usually are hedged, such as the validity of some usual mathematical expressions or the correctness of pore-scale results representing larger scales. Finally, this study proposes a mathematical relationship between pore-scale parameters and some important macro-scale dimensionless numbers that can be used to estimate field-scale effective parameters for nanoparticle retention in well stimulation and Oil&Gas industry applications.},

   abstract = {Recent developments based on nanotechnology have shown the immense potential of application in EOR & IOR operations, which is supported by successful results on the lab and field-scales. However, the poor understanding and the shortage of a robust framework for nanoparticle transport-and-retention modelling in porous media is a downside for its properly spread in the O & G industry. In this work, we propose a novel modelling framework that allows to represent jointly mechanical and chemical mechanisms for nanoparticle retention and remobilisation in porous media. This model is formulated under a phenomenological approach that considers a strong physical basis of these processes on the macroscale. Retention and remobilisation dynamics are modelled under a nonequilibrium approximation using an α-order kinetic which depends on equilibrium condition. The mathematical formulation was programmed using the open-source package Chebfun, as a function of dimensionless variables to make up-scaling to higher scales more feasible. The impact of dimensionless variables in nanoparticle transport and retention was studied by a sensibility analysis which allowed to identify their effect on nanoparticle transport and retention. In this sense, some simplifications are proposed for the model according to the dimensionless variables. In order to validate this framework and its implementation, a set of lab tests was designed and carried out using silica-nanoparticle-based nanofluid in sand packs. Some concentration jumps were used to catch its effect on nanoparticle retention and remobilisation. Experimental data show a good agreement with simulation data under each operation condition and parameter fitting. Additionally, the model is capable of predicting the profile of nanoparticle concentration and its evolution on time. Changes in that profile can be predicted if operating conditions change, allowing their optimisation. Finally, this modelling framework is implemented in the multiphysic and multi-component tool DFTmp Simulator to simulate specific EOR & IOR application on the fieldscale. Using the fitting parameters obtained previously, an application of IOR is simulated considering a multiphase system and other phenomena simultaneously.},

Injection conditions were evaluated with thermal simulations to analyze the response in oil production, allowing to find a deployment strategy having the highest recovery with the lowest gas injection volume. Results agree with experimental observations regarding the starting times for co-injection and help to narrow the uncertainty range where gas and steam co-injection is a suitable recovery technique in heavy oil reservoirs. The study showed that the incremental oil recovery factor can be enhanced, at least, in 40% when optimizing the deployment of steam and flue gas co-injection for the well studied here.},

   abstract = {Subsurface multiphase flow in porous media simulation is extensively used in many disci-plines. Large meshes with non-orthogonalities (e.g., corner point geometries) and full tensor highly anisotropy ratios are usually required for subsurface flow applications. Nonetheless, simulations using two-point flux approximations (TPFA) fail to accurately calculate fluxes in these types of meshes. Several simulators account for non-orthogonal meshes, but their discretization method is usually non-conservative. In this work, we propose a semi-implicit procedure for general compositional flow simulation in highly anisotropic porous media as an extension of TPFA. This procedure accounts for non-orthogonalities by adding corrections to residual in the Newton-Raphson method. Our semi-implicit formulation poses the guideline for FlowTraM (Flow and Transport Modeller ) implementation for research and industry subsurface purposes. We validated FlowTraM with a non-orthogonal variation of the Third SPE Comparative Solution Project case. Our model is used to successfully simulating a real Colombian oil field.},

   abstract = {Thermal techniques remain to be one of the most successful recovery methods for heavy oil production. Nanotechnology has opened an opportunity to take the advantage of thermal EOR methods to another level, leading to the emergence of in-situ upgrading: a permanent enhancing of thermodynamic properties leading to an increase in the oil recovery and the commercial value of the upgraded oil. Currently, there is not a clear approach to extrapolate the available experimental findings to reservoir conditions, based on the use of a generalized model representing the relevant phenomenology. This study presents a rigorous mathematical description of in-situ upgrading, by coupling the transport equations with kinetic models and an equation of state, allowing for a thermodynamic description of the complex mixtures. The paper introduces the formulation and implementation of the model, presents a benchmark case to compare thermal results, and numerical verification of a recent upgrading experiment is provided. With the calibrated parameters, the model is able to reproduce experimental measurements during the steam and nanocatalyst injection, such as the enhanced oil recovery and the improving of thermodynamic properties such as density (or API gravity) and viscosity. The model also provides additional insights into important time-dependent processes, such as local kinetic reactions, nanoparticle retention on the porous rock, or species distribution, that cannot be measured in the laboratory. The model can be used to design a field-scale deployment strategy for increasing both, recoverable reserves and the quality of upgraded oil.},

   abstract = {It is known that thermodynamic properties of a system change upon confinement. To know how, is important for modelling of porous media. We propose to use Hill’s systematic thermodynamic analysis of confined systems to describe two-phase equilibrium in a nanopore. The integral pressure, as defined by the compression energy of a small volume, is then central. We show that the integral pressure is constant along a slit pore with a liquid and vapor in equilibrium, when Young and Young–Laplace’s laws apply. The integral pressure of a bulk fluid in a slit pore at mechanical equilibrium can be understood as the average tangential pressure inside the pore. The pressure at mechanical equilibrium, now named differential pressure, is the average of the trace of the mechanical pressure tensor divided by three as before. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we computed the integral and differential pressures, ̂p and p, respectively, analysing the data with a growing-core methodology. The value of the bulk pressure was confirmed by Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. The pressure difference times the volume, V, is the subdivision potential of Hill, (p − ̂p)V = ɛ. The combined simulation results confirm that the integral pressure is constant along the pore, and that ɛ/V scales with the inverse pore width. This scaling law will be useful for prediction of thermodynamic properties of confined systems in more complicated geometries.},

   abstract = {In conventional permeable media, once pore volume (PV) is known, the amount of fluid-in-place can be estimated. This is because the fluid is locally homogeneous, pores are generally larger than 100 nm, and surface adsorption is negligible. In shale media, in addition to PV, knowledge of pore-size distribution, total organic content, and chemistry of the rock is required. Fluid molecules in shale media can be found in three different states: (1) free molecules in the pores, (2) adsorbed molecules on the pore surface, and (3) dissolved molecules in the organic matter. Of the three, the first two mechanisms are discussed in the literature. In this work, we compute for the first time the amount of dissolved molecules. To compute the fluids in shale media, we divide the pores into sizes greater than 10 nm and sizes less than 10 nm. In pores greater than 10 nm, the interface curvature affects phase behavior, and fluid phases are homogeneous. Therefore, they can be described by conventional equations of state. Our calculations show that retrograde condensation increases in nanopores; the upper dewpoint increases, and the lower dewpoint decreases. These calculations are supported by experimental measurements. Gas solubility in water and liquid normal decane shows a modest increase with curvature. In pores less than 10 nm, the fluids become inhomogeneous, and the direct use of conventional equations of state cannot be applied even with adjusted critical pressure and temperature. We suggest the use of molecular modeling. A model such as the Langmuir adsorption isotherm is merely a curve fitting of the data. We use available data in shale media, which are mainly limited to excess sorption of methane and carbon dioxide, to compare to our thermodynamic model computations. This is the first attempt to compare measured data in shale and predictions that are based on the integration of molecular modeling and classical thermodynamic modeling.},
